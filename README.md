# Building Containers for HPC

By Charles Peterson

This workshop is a follow-up to a previous workshop on “Using Containers on HPC Resources”.  This workshop will focus on creating containers to be ran on HPC resources. We will go over building containers using Docker/podman and Apptainer/Singularity. We will also use Hoffman2 to run our newly built containers. To follow along, users will need to install Docker or podman as well as Apptainer or Singularity on a computer they have root/admin access (Or you can just listen a watch). A GitHub or DockerHub account would also be needed to store our containers. We will provide a VM image for VituralBox with the software install. Any questions can be directed to cpeterson@oarc.ucla.edu.
